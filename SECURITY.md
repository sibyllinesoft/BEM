# Security Policy

## Our Commitment

The BEM (Basis Extension Modules) project takes security seriously. As a research project with potential production applications, we are committed to identifying, addressing, and preventing security vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported | Notes |
| ------- | --------- | ----- |
| 2.x.x   | ✅ | Current major version |
| 1.x.x   | ⚠️ | Critical security fixes only |
| < 1.0   | ❌ | No longer supported |

## Security Scope

### In Scope
- **Core BEM Framework**: All modules in `src/bem_core/` and `src/bem2/`
- **Training Pipeline**: Model training and fine-tuning components
- **Inference Pipeline**: Model serving and prediction endpoints
- **Data Processing**: Input validation, data preprocessing, and output sanitization
- **Configuration Management**: YAML/JSON configuration parsing and validation
- **Deployment Scripts**: Docker containers and deployment automation
- **API Endpoints**: Any HTTP/REST interfaces provided

### Out of Scope
- **Research Experiments**: Files in `experiments/` and `results/` directories
- **Legacy Components**: Deprecated modules in `src/bem_legacy/`
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Issues in upstream libraries (report to upstream)
- **Infrastructure**: Hosting provider security (cloud platforms, etc.)

## Threat Model

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Model Injection Attacks**: Malicious model weights or adversarial inputs
2. **Data Poisoning**: Contaminated training or inference data
3. **Prompt Injection**: Adversarial prompts designed to bypass safety mechanisms
4. **Memory Corruption**: Buffer overflows in CUDA kernels or native extensions
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized access to model parameters or training data
6. **Information Disclosure**: Leakage of training data, model architectures, or proprietary algorithms

### Security Controls
- **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Model Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of model weights and checkpoints
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Constitutional safety and violation detection systems
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
- **Resource Limits**: Protection against resource exhaustion attacks
- **Secure Configuration**: Default-secure configuration options

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via one of these methods:

#### Email (Preferred)
Send details to: `security@bem-research.org` (or `nathan@example.com` until dedicated address is available)

Include:
- **Subject Line**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of vulnerability`
- **Severity**: Your assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Component**: Which part of BEM is affected
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Impact**: Potential security impact
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for mitigation

#### GitHub Security Advisories
For complex issues, you can use GitHub's private security advisory feature:
1. Go to the repository's Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Follow the guided form

### What to Expect

We aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within **48 hours** and provide regular updates on our investigation.

#### Our Process
1. **Acknowledgment** (within 48 hours)
   - Confirm receipt of your report
   - Assign internal tracking ID
   - Provide initial assessment timeline

2. **Investigation** (within 7 days)
   - Validate and reproduce the issue
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Develop mitigation strategy

3. **Resolution** (timeline depends on severity)
   - Develop and test fix
   - Prepare security advisory
   - Coordinate disclosure timeline

4. **Disclosure**
   - Apply fix in supported versions
   - Publish security advisory
   - Credit reporter (if desired)

#### Timeline Expectations
- **Critical**: Fix within 24-72 hours
- **High**: Fix within 1 week
- **Medium**: Fix within 1 month
- **Low**: Fix in next regular release

## Vulnerability Assessment

We classify vulnerabilities using the following criteria:

### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Training data extraction
- Model parameter theft

### High  
- Denial of service attacks
- Privilege escalation
- Information disclosure of sensitive data
- Safety mechanism bypass

### Medium
- Input validation bypass
- Configuration manipulation  
- Performance degradation attacks
- Non-sensitive information disclosure

### Low
- Error message information leakage
- Minor configuration issues
- Logging inconsistencies

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
- **Validate Inputs**: Sanitize all inputs to BEM models
- **Secure Configuration**: Review security-relevant configuration options
- **Monitor Resources**: Set appropriate resource limits and monitoring
- **Network Security**: Use proper network controls in production
- **Access Control**: Implement appropriate authentication and authorization

### For Developers
- **Secure Coding**: Follow secure development practices
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs at system boundaries  
- **Error Handling**: Avoid information leakage in error messages
- **Testing**: Include security test cases in contributions
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and audit regularly
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code review for all changes

## Security Features
