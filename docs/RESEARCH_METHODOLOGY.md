# BEM Fleet Research Methodology

## 🔬 Scientific Framework

The BEM Fleet implements a rigorous research methodology designed to produce publication-quality results within a 60-day sprint. Our approach combines parallel experimentation, statistical validation, and systematic evaluation to ensure reproducible, significant findings.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

### Primary Research Questions
1. **Adaptive Specialization**: Can controllers learn to generate meaningful adaptation signals that outperform static approaches?
2. **Multi-Mission Composition**: Do multiple BEMs work together without interference while maintaining performance?
3. **Safety Integration**: Can alignment enforcement be achieved without significant performance degradation?
4. **Long-Context Scaling**: Do memory-coupled systems outperform traditional approaches at extended context lengths?
5. **Real-Time Learning**: Can online learning correct failures within reasonable time bounds?

### Hypothesis Framework
Each mission tests specific hypotheses with measurable outcomes:

| Mission | Primary Hypothesis | Expected Effect |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **A** | Agentic planning improves compositional reasoning | ≥+1.5% EM/F1 |
| **B** | Online learning corrects failures efficiently | ≤1k prompts to fix |
| **C** | Safety enforcement preserves performance | ≥30% violation reduction, ≤1% drop |
| **D** | Pretraining improves out-of-distribution transfer | Reduced surface dependence |
| **E** | Memory coupling scales to long contexts | Superior at 128k–512k tokens |

### Controlled Variables

## 🎲 Statistical Validation Framework

### Rigorous Statistical Standards

Our validation framework ensures statistical rigor appropriate for peer review:

#### 1. Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (BCa)
- **Method**: Bias-Corrected and Accelerated Bootstrap
- **Samples**: 10,000 bootstrap replicates
- **Confidence**: 95% confidence intervals
- **Bias Correction**: Accounts for non-normal distributions
- **Acceleration**: Corrects for skewness in bootstrap distribution

```python
def bca_bootstrap(data1, data2, statistic_func, n_bootstrap=10000):
    """
    BCa Bootstrap implementation for mission evaluation
    """
    # Bootstrap sampling with bias and acceleration corrections
    # Returns confidence intervals and statistical significance
```

#### 2. Multiple Testing Correction (FDR)
- **Method**: Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate control
- **Level**: 5% FDR across all mission comparisons
- **Scope**: Applied to primary and secondary metrics
- **Rationale**: Controls family-wise error rate in multi-mission testing

#### 3. Paired Statistical Testing
- **Design**: Paired comparisons against baselines
- **Tests**: Paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank, McNemar's test
- **Power Analysis**: Minimum detectable effect size calculations
- **Sample Size**: Determined by power analysis (≥80% power)

### Effect Size Requirements

Statistical significance must be accompanied by practical significance:

| Mission | Primary Metric | Minimum Effect Size | Statistical Test |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| A | EM/F1 Improvement | Cohen's d ≥ 0.5 | Paired t-test |
| B | Time to Fix | Cohen's d ≥ 0.8 | Wilcoxon signed-rank |
| C | Violation Reduction | Cohen's d ≥ 0.6 | Paired proportion test |
| D | Transfer Improvement | Cohen's d ≥ 0.4 | Paired t-test |
| E | Context Scaling | Cohen's d ≥ 0.5 | Mixed-effects model |
