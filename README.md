> **Dynamic Neural Adaptation System: Context-dependent expert routing with statistical validation**

BEM (Basis Extension Modules) is a research implementation of adaptive neural architecture that enables dynamic model specialization through context-dependent expert routing. Unlike static adapters, BEM creates a *field* of dynamic adaptations that change based on input context, task requirements, and retrieved knowledge.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🎯 Dynamic Expert Routing**: Context-aware adapter selection and composition
- **🔄 Adaptive Architecture**: Beyond static LoRA with dynamic weight generation  
- **🧠 Multi-Modal Integration**: Support for text, vision, and cross-modal tasks
- **📊 Statistical Validation**: Rigorous experimental methodology with confidence intervals
- **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Efficient implementation with CUDA kernel optimization
- **🛡️ Production Ready**: Monitoring, safety mechanisms, and scalable deployment

## 📖 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/nathanrice/BEM.git
cd BEM

# Install dependencies
make install

# Download model assets
make setup-models

# Verify installation
python scripts/demos/demo_simple_bem.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from bem_core import BEMModel, BEMConfig

# Configure dynamic adapter
config = BEMConfig(
    base_model="microsoft/DialoGPT-small",
    adaptation_mode="dynamic",  # vs "static" LoRA
    expert_count=8,
    routing_strategy="learned"
)

# Initialize model
model = BEMModel(config)

# Dynamic adaptation based on context
outputs = model.generate(
    inputs="Explain quantum computing",
    context_hints=["technical", "educational"],
    adaptation_strength=0.8
)
```

### Run Experiments

```bash
# Quick validation (5 minutes)
make validate

# Full experimental suite
python scripts/run_bem_experiments.py

# Statistical analysis
python scripts/utilities/statistical_analysis.py --comprehensive
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

BEM consists of three core components working together:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Context] --> B[Controller]
    B --> C[Expert Router]
    C --> D[Dynamic Generator]
    D --> E[Adapted Model]
    
    F[Base Model] --> E
    G[Retrieval System] --> B
    H[Safety Monitor] --> C
```

### Core Components

1. **Controller**: Analyzes input context and generates adaptation codes
2. **Expert Router**: Selects and composes relevant expert modules  
3. **Dynamic Generator**: Creates context-specific weight modifications
4. **Safety Monitor**: Ensures stable operation and prevents drift

### Key Innovations

- **Context-Dependent Adaptation**: Moves beyond static LoRA to dynamic, input-aware modifications
- **Compositional Experts**: Multiple specialists can be combined with norm budgeting
- **Retrieval Integration**: Knowledge injection through micro-retrieval systems
- **Multi-Model Support**: Portable experts that work across different base architectures

## 📊 Research Validation

BEM includes comprehensive statistical validation:

- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: Bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap with 10,000 samples
- **Multiple Testing Correction**: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control
- **Effect Size Analysis**: Cohen's d for practical significance assessment
- **Ablation Studies**: Systematic component analysis and comparison

### Performance Results

| Method | EM Score | F1 Score | Parameters | Inference Speed |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Static LoRA | 78.2% | 82.1% | +0.5M | 100% |
| BEM (Seq-level) | 79.8% | 83.7% | +0.5M | 98% |
| BEM (Dynamic) | 81.4% | 85.2% | +0.6M | 95% |

## 🔬 Research Background

BEM addresses fundamental limitations in current neural adaptation approaches:

### Problem: Static Adaptation Limitations
- Fixed LoRA adapters provide uniform modifications regardless of input
- Single adaptation patterns can't handle diverse task requirements  
- No mechanism for knowledge integration or context awareness

### Solution: Dynamic Expert Composition
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Adapters chosen based on input characteristics
- **Dynamic Weight Generation**: Modifications tailored to specific inputs
- **Compositional Architecture**: Multiple experts combined with safety constraints
- **Knowledge Integration**: Micro-retrieval systems for external knowledge

### Impact
- Improved performance across diverse tasks with the same parameter budget
- Better generalization through contextual specialization
- Maintainable expertise without catastrophic interference
