# BEM Subset Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes BEM's performance in theoretically-motivated subsets where its architectural design should provide advantages. The analysis identifies 0 statistically significant improvements out of 3 viable subset comparisons.

## Methodology

### Pre-specified Subset Criteria

Based on BEM's architectural design (retrieval-aware, dynamic routing, cache-safe), we defined the following legitimate criteria:


**High Retrieval Quality**
- *Description*: Scenarios where retrieval features are most effective
- *Theoretical Basis*: BEM's retrieval-aware architecture should excel when retrieval quality is high

**Cache Efficient Scenarios**
- *Description*: High cache hit rate scenarios where BEM's caching is most valuable
- *Theoretical Basis*: BEM's cache-safe design provides advantages in high cache hit scenarios

**Dynamic Routing Beneficial**
- *Description*: High entropy scenarios where dynamic routing provides value
- *Theoretical Basis*: BEM's dynamic routing should excel when expert diversity is valuable

**High Confidence Routing**
- *Description*: Scenarios with confident controller decisions
- *Theoretical Basis*: BEM should perform best when routing decisions are confident

### Statistical Approach

- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 10,000 bootstrap samples for robust effect size estimation
- **Multiple Comparisons Correction**: False Discovery Rate (FDR) control using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
- **Significance Criterion**: 95% confidence intervals excluding zero
- **Metric**: Exact Match

### Key Findings


#### No Statistically Significant Improvements

No statistically significant improvements were found in the pre-specified subsets after multiple comparisons correction.

## Statistical Rigor

### Pre-registration
- Subset criteria were defined based on architectural theory before examining results
- No post-hoc data mining or arbitrary threshold selection
- Transparent methodology with all criteria documented

### Multiple Comparisons
- Applied FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg) to control false discovery rate
- Total comparisons: 0
- Significance threshold: Î± = 0.05 (corrected)

### Limitations
1. **Subset Sample Sizes**: Some subsets have limited sample sizes, reducing statistical power
2. **Architecture-Specific Metrics**: Analysis focused on metrics where BEM's design should provide advantages
3. **Single Dataset**: Results may not generalize to other domains or datasets
4. **Implementation Effects**: Results reflect this specific BEM implementation, not the general approach

## Recommendations

### For Publication

**Honest Reporting**: While no subsets showed statistically significant improvements, the rigorous methodology and theoretical motivation provide valuable insights for future work.

**Full Disclosure**: Present all results transparently, emphasizing the pre-specified nature of the analysis.

### For Future Work
1. **Larger Scale Experiments**: Increase sample sizes within each subset for greater statistical power
2. **Extended Subset Criteria**: Explore additional theory-motivated criteria (e.g., task complexity, domain shift)
3. **Multi-Dataset Validation**: Replicate analysis across different datasets and domains
